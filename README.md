## Configure Authentication

There is an ```.env.dist``` template file in the root directory with links to which we can get all the necessary tokens for authentication. Fill the tokens in the applicable places in that file and then rename that file to ```.env```.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.


important:
1) the api call needs to be http or https need to be checked with postman.
2) the authorization token's surfix is Bearer or Basic needs to be checked.
